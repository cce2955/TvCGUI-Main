# TvC Continuo

A Python-based live memory overlay for Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars (Wii), running on Dolphin Emulator.
This suite connects directly to Dolphin's RAM and provides:

- A real-time training HUD with health, meter, baroque tracking, and frame advantage
- Live hitbox overlay with per-slot filtering
- Automated move-table and frame-data scanning
- Memory tools for debugging and reverse-engineering fighter structs

---

## Overview

TvC Continuo visualizes live match data pulled directly from Dolphin's memory.
It supports all four character slots (P1-C1, P1-C2, P2-C1, P2-C2) with dynamic pointer resolution to track state across tags, swaps, and giant normalization logic.

The HUD runs at a fixed 60 FPS and is designed to remain stable even during pointer churn, character swaps, assists, and match transitions.

---
## High-Level Overview

TvC Continuo is an all-in-one live training and reverse-engineering toolkit for Tatsunoko vs. Capcom running through Dolphin Emulator.

It reads game memory in real time to provide tools that do not exist in-game, including:

- Live HUD with health, meter, move states, and frame advantage
- Hitbox and projectile visualization overlays
- Mission mode with combo validation and progress tracking
- Automated frame-data extraction
- Debug flag editing and training mode enhancements
- Memory scanning and research utilities
- Character/move mapping systems for custom tools

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Requirements

- Windows
- TvC Continuo from the Release Page
- Dolphin Emulator
- Tatsunoko vs. Capcom (US build recommended)


### 2. Launch Dolphin

Start the game and enter training mode or a match.

### 3. Run Continuo

```bash
TvCGUI.exe
```

### 4. Use the HUD

Once hooked:

- View live fighter data
- Toggle overlays
- Open frame data tools
- Run mission mode
- Use debug tools

## Using Continuo

This section is the nontechnical guide to the main Continuo interface. It explains what each visible control does and when you would normally use it.

Continuo separates the **main control window** from the **in-game transparent overlay**. A button in the main window may toggle an in-game layer, change a training option, or open a dedicated tool window. Turning one layer off does not automatically disable the others.

### Main Window at a Glance

The main window is organized into four working areas:

1. **HUD** controls what information appears in the in-game team overlay.
2. **VISUALS** controls hitboxes, hurtboxes, and reach rulers.
3. **Character panels** show the current fighters and provide Frame Data, Profile Monitor, Mission Mode, and quick-assist controls.
4. **Bottom workspace** provides Normals, Advantage, Events, Debug, and Activity views.

Click **Tools** in the HUD section to expand the dedicated **TRAINING** and **LAB / SETUP** sections.

### HUD Section

These controls affect the informational layers shown over the game.

| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Overlay: ON/OFF** | Shows or hides the core team HUD. This does **not** turn off hitboxes, hurtboxes, rulers, Mission Mode, or trainer prompts. Those layers are independent. |
| **Hit / Block** | Shows or hides the live interaction ribbon used for hit and block feedback. |
| **Combo** | Shows or hides the live combo ledger and route information. |
| **Set: Core / Research / Full** | Cycles through HUD information presets. **Core** enables Meter and Red HP. **Research** adds the damage-scaling display. **Full** additionally enables Hit / Block, Combo, and Tag. Changing an individual HUD toggle changes the preset label to **Custom**. |
| **Dmg: ON/OFF** | Shows or hides the damage-scaling gauges beneath the character health information. |
| **Meter** | Shows or hides the extra meter gain/spend information beside the normal meter display. |
| **Red HP** | Shows or hides recoverable-health information, including the recoverable portion of the health bar and its amount. |
| **Research** | Opens the standalone **read-only Attack Research** window. This is separate from the **Set: Research** HUD preset and does not add another card to the match overlay. |
| **Tag** | Shows or hides the incoming tag resource card. |
| **Clear** | Hides the optional HUD cards in one click while leaving the core overlay available. It does not erase saved data, clear scans, or shut Continuo down. |
| **Tools** | Expands or collapses the TRAINING and LAB / SETUP sections. |


### Input Monitor and Charge Tracking

The in-game HUD includes a live input history for the active point fighter. It is meant to answer simple questions such as "Did the game actually see my input?", "How long did I hold that direction?", and "Was my button early or late?"

| Readout | What it means |
|---|---|
| **INPUTS** | Shows the most recent direction and button states using fighting-game numpad notation. The newest input is shown first. A, B, C, Partner, and Taunt inputs are included. |
| **FRAMES** | Shows how many frames each displayed input state lasted. The newest input continues counting until the input changes, then its final count is frozen. |
| **HOLD** | Appears when a button or charge direction has been held for at least 26 frames. While the hold is active, the chip says **HELD** and its frame counter continues increasing. After release, the completed hold remains briefly so you can see the final charge time. |

Same-frame direction and button inputs are grouped together when appropriate, while real repeated taps remain separate entries. This makes motions and confirms easier to read without hiding double taps or repeated button presses.

The HOLD row can track A, B, C, Partner, Taunt, and the eight non-neutral directions. This is especially useful for charge-based actions. For example, you can hold a charge input for Zero or Joe the Condor and see the exact number of frames held before release.

Continuo also includes a deeper **Input Monitor** view for inspecting a selected fighter slot. When that window is open, it shows the live held input, newly pressed and released buttons, recent input stream, current action, and the rule associated with that action. The monitor is **read-only**. It does not inject controller inputs, enable Dolphin debugging, install codes, or change Dolphin configuration.

### Damage Scaling

Turn on **Dmg** or use the **Research** HUD preset to show the live damage-scaling rows beneath the team HUD.

The percentage is a live outgoing damage modifier, not the move's listed base damage:

- **100%** means the fighter is currently at the normal base modifier.
- **Below 100%** means the current hit would be reduced by scaling or another damage-reduction factor.
- **Above 100%** means a damage bonus is currently active.
- A trailing **`*`** means at least one part of the displayed modifier is marked approximate by Continuo rather than fully resolved.

The C1 and C2 rows let you see the current modifier for both members of the team even when only one character is on point. The factor text explains why the percentage changed. Depending on the current match state, you may see labels such as:

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **TEAM SCALE** or **SCALE** | Current combo-proration multiplier. |
| **BAROQUE** | Damage adjustment currently associated with the attacker's active Baroque state. |
| **GUTS** | Low-health damage reduction on the defender. |
| **DANGER** | Low-health damage bonus on the attacker. |
| **LAST** | Last-character damage bonus when the teammate has been KO'd. |
| **ROLL / PUDDLES** | Roll-specific power or puddle bonuses. |
| **HEIGHT** | Height-based modifier currently being applied. |
| **VAR / DHC / START / TEAM** | Team or sequence correction currently affecting damage. |
| **SCRIPT ?** | Continuo detected an additional script-side modifier but cannot yet resolve its exact contribution. |
| **BASE** | No additional live modifier is currently being displayed. |

In per-hit breakdowns, Continuo may also show **POINT TRACK 5% -> 35%** or **ASSIST TRACK 3% -> 43%**. The first number is the loss applied as that proration lane advances, and the second number is the floor for that lane. The label tells you which scaling track Continuo is using for the breakdown.

Damage scaling is useful for comparing the same route under different conditions. It lets you see when a combo is losing damage to proration, when Guts is reducing the result, or when Baroque and character-specific bonuses are changing the expected damage.

### Visuals Section

The visual controls are independent from the core HUD.

| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Hitboxes: ON/OFF** | Shows or hides attack and projectile hitbox drawings for all currently enabled hitbox slots. |
| **Hitbox 1 / 2 / 3 / 4** | Enables or disables hitbox drawing for one fighter slot without changing the others. |
| **Hurtboxes: ON/OFF** | Shows or hides body and defender hurtbox drawings for all currently enabled hurtbox slots. |
| **Hurtbox 1 / 2 / 3 / 4** | Enables or disables hurtbox drawing for one fighter slot. |
| **Ruler: ON/OFF** | Shows or hides saved active-frame reach guides. |
| **Horizontal** | Shows the furthest forward edge of the saved active hitbox reach. |
| **Vertical** | Shows the full vertical active-hitbox envelope. Horizontal and Vertical can be enabled together. |
| **Ruler 1 / 2 / 3 / 4** | Chooses which fighter slots are allowed to contribute saved ruler guides. |

The numbered visual slots map to the four fighter slots as follows:

| Visual slot | Fighter slot |
|---|---|
| **1** | P1-C1 |
| **2** | P2-C1 |
| **3** | P1-C2 |
| **4** | P2-C2 |

### Character Panel Buttons

Each live fighter panel has its own controls. These buttons always apply to the fighter shown in that panel.

| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Frame Data** | Opens the detailed Frame Data workbench for that fighter. If the rich profile is not ready yet, Continuo opens a loading window and prepares it automatically. |
| **Profile Monitor** | Opens that fighter slot's projectile profile monitor. It lists the character's known possible projectiles and automatically selects the matching live projectile when one appears in-game. |
| **Mission Mode** | Turns Mission Mode on or off for that fighter slot. Mission Mode is its own overlay layer and does not switch the normal HUD or collision overlays on or off. |

**Right-click a fighter panel** to copy that fighter's current base address to the clipboard. This is mainly useful for research and development.

### Understanding Frame Data

The **Frame Data** workbench contains the familiar timing values, but it also exposes several TvC-specific protection and cancel fields that are easy to misread. Select a move to populate the inspector and frame timeline.

#### Basic timing and advantage

| Entry | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Startup** | Frames before the move becomes active. |
| **Active** | Main active hitbox window. |
| **Active 2** | A second separated active window when the move has another active phase. |
| **Hitstop** | Freeze frames caused by the hit. |
| **Hitstun** | Time the opponent remains in hitstun after the hit. |
| **Blockstun** | Time the opponent remains in blockstun. |
| **Observed Block Adv** | Block advantage measured from actual gameplay captures. When available, this is the preferred value for matchup and punish decisions. |
| **Derived Block Adv** | Block advantage calculated from the frame-data fields Continuo has decoded. It is useful when no observed value exists, but it may be less reliable when a move has an unusual recovery or cancel structure. |

#### Protection and cancel entries

| Entry | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Invuln** | Frames where the move is excluded from normal collision. This is invulnerability, not armor. |
| **Counter** | A native protection path detected on the move. This label does **not** mean "counter hit." It is tracked separately from guard points and armor. |
| **Guard Point** | Frames where the move's native protection can guard the listed attack heights. It is not the same thing as full invulnerability. |
| **Armor** | Frames where armor is active. When runtime-confirmed, this is the protection path where the fighter can take damage without entering ordinary hitstun. |
| **Protection** | The combined workbench column that summarizes detected Counter, Guard Point, and Armor information for the move. |
| **Baroque Window** | Frames where that move's native Baroque-cancel gate is open. This does **not** mean the character currently has red life or can Baroque for resource reasons. It only tells you when the move itself permits the cancel. |
| **Cancel windows ?** | Continuo's focused decoder for native cancel-window records found for the move. A move can have more than one window. |
| **Custom Cancel** | A user-editable Continuo window used for lab and balance-patch work. It is **not** the game's decoded native cancel window. |

Where a protection or cancel entry includes **`[R]`**, the listed frame range was observed directly at runtime. Some static invulnerability entries can instead carry confidence markers such as **`[C]`**, **`[H]`**, **`[M]`**, or **`[L]`**. Those markers describe the confidence of the static identification rather than a live-captured frame range.

#### Other useful entries

| Entry | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Attack Property** | Human-readable decoding of important attack-property flags attached to the hit. |
| **Hit Reaction** | What the hit does to the opponent, such as knockback, knockdown, launcher, stagger, crumple, wallbounce, or another special reaction. |
| **Hit Result** | Additional result flags associated with the hit packet. |
| **KB Style / Extra Launch / Launch Adjust / KB X / Arc** | Knockback and launch behavior used to describe where the opponent is sent. |
| **Speed Mod** | A move-local timing modifier that can change how the scripted action progresses. |
| **SuperBG** | The move's super-background flag when that record is available. |
| **Address** | The underlying move-record address. This is mainly useful for research or editing work. |

The **FRAME TIMELINE** in the inspector draws startup, active, invulnerability, Counter, Guard Point, Armor, and Baroque-cancel ranges together so you can see how the windows overlap. Clicking the timeline edits the **Custom Cancel** window only. It does not rewrite the native Baroque or protection windows.

### Quick Assist Buttons

When assist profiles are available, a fighter panel also shows an **Assist** row with up to four quick buttons.

Clicking a quick-assist button selects that configured assist profile for the fighter in that panel. The currently selected assist is highlighted. Use **Assist Setup** when you need to inspect or change the underlying assist choices.

### Normals and Advantage Workspace

The **NORMALS** tab compares the normal attacks for all four currently loaded fighter slots. Its highlight controls are designed to answer common matchup questions without opening the full Frame Data workbench.

| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Fastest** | Highlights each character's fastest valid grounded normal and fastest valid aerial normal. |
| **Damage** | Highlights the highest listed primary-hit damage normal for the grounded and aerial groups. |
| **Block** | Highlights the normal with the best block advantage in each grounded and aerial group. Observed block advantage is preferred when available. |
| **Matchup** | After you select a move row, highlights the equivalent normal notation on the opposing team so the same button/command can be compared directly. |
| **Advanced** | Expands or collapses the extra Safe and Unsafe highlight filters. |
| **Safe** | Highlights each character's best non-negative block-advantage normal for grounded and aerial groups. |
| **Unsafe** | Highlights the most punishable listed normal in each grounded and aerial group. |
| **Punish** | Select a move row to find the opposing team's fastest legal normal punish and highest-damage legal normal punish within that move's block disadvantage. |
| **Live Punish** | Watches the point character's currently executing normal and automatically performs the same punish lookup. If the move is safe, the status line says so instead. |

Click an active highlight button again to clear it. If you click a move row while no metric filter is active, Continuo automatically treats the selection as a **Punish** query.

Clicking the **ADVANTAGE** tab opens the separate **Advantage Matrix** window. The matrix is intended for broader character-to-character punish comparison using the available observed frame data. Negative entries can be inspected for punish options.

### Bottom Workspace Tabs

| Tab | What it does |
|---|---|
| **NORMALS** | Opens the four-character normal-move comparison and highlight tools described above. |
| **ADVANTAGE** | Opens the Advantage Matrix in a separate window. It does not replace the current bottom tab. |
| **EVENTS** | Shows the recent live combat event feed. |
| **DEBUG** | Shows the advanced training/debug flag panel. This panel is write-capable and is intended for users who know which training flags they want to change. Right-clicking a debug row copies its address and performs that row's toggle or cycle action, so use it intentionally. |
| **ACTIVITY** | Shows the current or most recent compact activity/advantage readout. |

### Training Tools

Open these controls with **Tools**.

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Cancel Mapper** | Opens a read-only map of the selected character's known cancel relationships. Choose a source move to see targets marked **Allowed**, **Eligible**, **Blocked**, or **Unknown**. Use this when you want to inspect what should cancel into what without running a live cancel test. |
| **Cancel Lab** | Opens the live cancel-testing tool. Choose a fighter, source action, one or more target actions, and a frame window, then test or arm that route. Manual mode waits for the real target input before routing the requested action. |
| **Action Recorder** | Records clean action transitions for a selected fighter slot. Rejected command attempts are kept separately, and captures can be copied or saved as CSV. Useful when you want to see exactly what actions the game recognized. |
| **Timing Monitor** | Shows live hitstop, hitstun, blockstun, and observed advantage. You can arm a Whiff, Hit, or Block capture, then copy or save the captured timing data. |
| **Punish Trainer** | Lets you choose a fighter slot and move, then repeatedly executes that move after a fixed or random countdown. Use it to practice reactions, defense, or punishes against a repeatable setup. |
| **Megacrash Trainer** | Opens the configurable Megacrash reaction trainer. Choose the watched character, move label, matching hit occurrence, trigger chance, delay, and cooldown, then arm the route. See [Megacrash Trainer](#megacrash-trainer) below for the full control guide. |

### Megacrash Trainer

**Megacrash Trainer** is a write-capable practice tool that forces Megacrash under conditions you choose. It is designed for practicing reactions and defensive situations that would be tedious to recreate manually.

The trainer follows one route: a matching hit occurs, the requested occurrence is reached, the chance roll succeeds, the selected delay passes, and then Megacrash is forced.

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Character** | Chooses which live point fighter the trainer watches. **Any active point** allows either active point fighter to qualify. |
| **Label** | Chooses the move that must hit. **Any label** allows any qualifying move. The list is grouped into normals, specials, supers, projectiles, and other actions for easier browsing. |
| **Occurrence** | Chooses which matching hit in the current combo should be used, such as the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd occurrence of the selected move. |
| **Chance** | Sets the percentage chance that Megacrash will actually trigger after the selected occurrence is reached. Use 100% for a completely repeatable drill or a lower value for reaction practice. |
| **Crash delay** | Adds a delay in frames after a successful chance roll before Megacrash occurs. |
| **Cooldown** | Minimum time after a forced Megacrash before the trainer can trigger another one. |
| **ARM / OFF** | Turns the configured trainer route on or off. Opening the window does not by itself mean the trainer is armed. |

The live status area shows the current route, the game's combo count when available, and how many matching hits have been seen toward the requested occurrence.

For example, if you choose **P1-C1**, **5B**, **2nd occurrence**, **50% chance**, and **+5f delay**, the trainer waits for the second matching 5B hit in the combo. It then makes a 50% roll. If that roll succeeds, Megacrash is forced five frames later, followed by the configured cooldown.

**Reset defaults** restores **Any active point**, **Any label**, **1st occurrence**, **100% chance**, **+5f delay**, and **3s cooldown**. Resetting the settings does not unexpectedly change the current armed/off state.

### Lab and Setup Tools

These controls are also opened with **Tools**. Several of them intentionally change live game state, so use them when you are setting up training or research rather than during normal play.

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Assist Setup** | Opens the shared-character assist picker. It shows the assist profile for each loaded fighter, lets you choose a fighter's assist, refresh the cached routes, and control automatic assist triggering for duplicate characters. |
| **Stage Control** | Opens direct stage-carousel control. While the in-game stage carousel is open, **Grab live ID** reads the current stage ID and **Previous**, **Apply ID**, and **Next** move or set the selected ID. |
| **Extra Characters: ON/OFF** | Activates Yami 1, Yami 2, and Yami 3 on the character select screen. It also exposes a solo character slot. |
| **KO Control: ON/OFF** | Enables or restores Continuo's post-KO control path so the surviving fighter can remain controllable for post-KO lab work.  |
| **Dump Memory** | Creates a zipped snapshot of Dolphin's MEM1 and MEM2 regions for research, comparison, or bug reports. The file is written under `memory_dumps/`. |
| **Win Score** | Opens the live HUD score editor. It can inspect or change visible win counts, score, stage digit, and timer display, and can hold displayed win counts through `NEW HERO` resets. It is turned on by default. |
| **Tool Status** | Opens the runtime status and safety panel. It shows the state of major Continuo tools and exposes maintenance controls such as Refresh, Dump, Safe Restore, and Hard Reset. |

- Dynamic character metadata caching (true struct ID + CSV correction)
- Panel slide and fade animations
- Clipboard integration (right-click fighter panel to copy base address)
- Scrollable debug overlay
---

### HUD Overlay Evolution

The real time HUD now works in game, so you can see everything without hopping to an alt screen

### Visual Upgrades

- Fully redesigned row layout with dynamic width scaling
- Metallic neo-futurist panel styling
- Team-colored borders and accent rails
- Animated scanline energy sweeps across active players
- Fade-in / fade-out transitions for appearing slots
- Smooth value interpolation for meters and UI elements
- Responsive scaling for different Dolphin window sizes
- Cleaner spacing, typography, and alignment
- Improved contrast for instant readability
- Multi-layer alpha effects and glow treatments

### Live Combat Feedback

The overlay now reacts to gameplay events in real time instead of only showing static values.

New popup systems include:

- Damage popups on hit
- Meter gain popups
- Baroque gain / loss popups
- Live frame advantage popups
- Move history timeline
- Highlighted newest route step
- Animated current-state emphasis

Each event fades, animates, and stacks cleanly during fast gameplay. 

### Enhanced Data Display

Every slot can now show richer live combat information including:

- Current HP and max HP
- Animated health bars
- Meter pips plus raw meter values
- Current move labels
- Passive vs active state dimming
- Baroque readiness state
- Stored red-life percentage
- Frame advantage outcomes
- Assist state awareness
- Active character detection
- Team slot identity (C1 / C2)

### Smart Match Logic

The overlay now makes decisions based on match state rather than blindly printing memory values.

Examples include:

- Detecting active point character vs assist
- Cross-team frame advantage pairing
- Ignoring passive states
- Tracking combo gaps correctly
- Resetting stale interactions
- Preserving popup history briefly after events
- Handling tag scenarios more cleanly
- Stable rendering during pointer churn

### Move History System

A major quality-of-life upgrade is the route history display.

Recent actions are shown in sequence, such as:

```text
5A > 5B > 2B > 5C > Baroque Cancel > j.B
```

The newest action is highlighted, older steps fade over time, and Baroque actions receive custom animated styling.

This turns the HUD into a real combo-learning tool rather than just a stat panel.


---

### Hitbox Overlay

- Launch a live hitbox visualizer directly from the HUD with one click
- Per-slot color-coded filter checkboxes (P1/P2/P3/P4)
- Runtime slot filter persisted via hitbox_filter.json
- Overlay runs as an independent subprocess
- Automatic overlay shutdown when the HUD exits
- Live process monitoring (overlay state reflects actual subprocess state)

---

### Frame Data Scanner

- Deep MEM2 analysis via scan_normals_all.py
- Extracts:
  - Startup
  - Active
  - Recovery
  - Hitstun
  - Blockstun
  - Observed and derived block advantage
  - Invulnerability and protection windows
  - Counter, guard point, and armor detection
  - Native Baroque cancel windows
  - Hit reaction and attack-property summaries
  - Damage
  - Knockback
  - Meter values
- Computes estimated frame advantage on hit and block
- Interactive move-table window per character slot
- Background scan worker (non-blocking)
- Auto-scan on character change
- F5 refreshes the currently visible fields inside the Frame Data workbench
- Synchronous fallback scan if worker is unavailable
- Slide-in animation when new scan data arrives

---
## Mission Mode

TvC Continuo now includes a full in-game combo trial and training mission system built directly into the live HUD.

Mission Mode transforms the toolkit from a viewer into an active training platform by validating routes in real time, tracking progress, and celebrating successful clears.

### Core Features

- Per-character mission packs
- Live combo step validation
- Real-time progress tracking
- Auto-reset on dropped routes
- Mission completion save data
- Dynamic mission selection overlay
- Completion celebration effects
- Integrated with the main HUD
- Works directly from live memory state
- No emulator mods required

### How It Works

Each mission contains a sequence of expected actions such as:

```text
5A -> 5B -> 2B -> 5C -> 6C -> Issen
```

The system watches live animation IDs, move labels, hit states, damage confirms, and combo state transitions.

When the correct next action occurs, progress advances instantly.

If the combo drops before completion, progress resets and the player can retry immediately.

### Validation Logic

Mission validation is deeper than simple input matching.

The engine can detect:

- Correct move order
- Fresh move instances
- Repeated moves counted separately
- Damage-confirmed actions
- Baroque cancels
- Whiff-confirmed utility moves
- Combo state continuity
- Hitstun / reaction state transitions
- Route completion
- Route failure and reset

This allows missions to behave like real combo trials instead of basic macro checklists.

### Mission Selection

Players can change missions without leaving training mode.

Open the selector with:

```text
Crouch, Crouch, Taunt
```

Then choose a mission directly from the overlay.

### Progress Saving

Completed missions are stored automatically.

The system tracks:

- Cleared missions
- Current selected mission
- Character mission progress

So players can return later without losing progress.

### Mission Examples

Examples of supported mission styles:

- Basic confirms
- Launcher routes
- Baroque extensions
- Metered enders
- Rejump combos
- Character-specific challenge routes
- Repetition tests
- Execution trials
- Advanced conversions

### Why It Matters

Most fighting games require external guides or combo videos.

Mission Mode brings structured practice directly into Tatsunoko vs. Capcom through Dolphin, with live validation and instant feedback.

That means players can learn routes faster, practice consistently, and build execution without guessing whether they did the combo correctly.

### Future Expansion Ideas

- Difficulty tiers
- Community mission packs
- Custom mission creator
- Time attack clears
- Combo score grading
- Character completion percentage
- Replay verification
- Advanced punish drills
- Defensive challenges
- Matchup-specific training missions
---
### Assist Phase Tracking

Each slot maintains a lightweight assist state machine:

```
None -> flyin -> attack -> recover -> None
```

Assist phases are inferred from animation IDs using:

```
ASSIST_FLYIN_IDS
ASSIST_ATTACK_IDS
```

Snapshots are augmented with:

```
snap["assist_phase"]
snap["is_assist"]
```

This system is conservative and animation-driven.
Future refinement can replace animation ID inference with explicit assist struct mapping.

---

### True 32-bit Baroque Detection

In addition to pool-byte tracking, TvC Continuo reads:

```
+0x28  HP32
+0x2C  Pool32
```

Baroque readiness is determined by:

```
hp32 != pool32
```

The HUD computes:

- baroque_local_hp32
- baroque_local_pool32
- baroque_ready_local
- baroque_red_amt
- baroque_red_pct_max

This avoids inaccuracies from 8-bit pool tracking and reflects actual red-life state.

---

### Memory Tools

- redscan.py / global_redscan.py - detect HP-correlated bytes (red-life / mystery bytes)
- memscan.py - scans MEM1 and MEM2 for ASCII strings and backreferences
- resolver.py - automatically resolves and validates fighter base pointers
- tvc_fill_bacluster.py - read, fill, and restore fighter float clusters (BA40-BA9F)

---

### Interactive Debug Flags

The debug panel supports direct memory writes:

- Toggle flags (PauseOverlay, FreeBaroque, CameraLock, etc.)
- Cycle values (CpuAction, CpuGuard, DummyMeter, CpuDifficulty)
- Momentary triggers (HypeTrigger, SpecialPopup)
- Coupled logic (P2Pause auto-syncs TrPause)

Momentary writes are automatically restored after a short delay to prevent unintended state corruption.

All debug writes are performed safely via wd8() and are guarded against failure.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Dolphin Emulator (US build recommended)
- Pygame

---

### Quick Setup (Windows)

Full HUD plus all tools:

```
run.bat
```

Hitbox overlay only:

```
hitbox.bat
```

Manual setup:

```
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install pygame
```

Ensure Dolphin is running TvC and memory read and write is enabled.
If your revision differs from the US build, update addresses in constants.py.

---

## Running the HUD

```
python main.py
```

Wait until the console shows Dolphin is hooked.
When connected, four fighter panels and the event log appear automatically.

---

## Frame Data Scanning

```
python -m scan_normals_all
```

Or click **Frame Data** on a fighter panel. Continuo loads or prepares the detailed profile automatically.
Displays move labels, startup, active frames, hitstun, blockstun, and computed frame advantage.

## Attacker Detection Logic

When a victim's HP drops or a hit state is detected, the system:

1. Logs a hit for that fighter
2. Finds the nearest opponent (distance squared heuristic)
3. Associates that attacker to compute live frame advantage

This method is consistent during training mode and normal gameplay.

## Troubleshooting

If the HUD says "waiting for Dolphin":

- Ensure Dolphin is running TvC
- Close duplicate Dolphin instances
- Relaunch both Dolphin and the HUD

---

## Developer Notes

- Bulk fighter struct reads use rbytes() for performance
- Character metadata cache refreshes automatically on ID change
- Safe wrappers prevent pointer churn from crashing the render loop
- RedScan requires multiple snapshots
- Frame advantage auto-corrects using active frames
- CSV output logged under HIT_CSV
- Compatible with modern Dolphin memory APIs (dolphin_io.py)
