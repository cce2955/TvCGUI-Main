3. Start Continuo and wait for the status rail to say Dolphin hooked.
4. Use the controls in the top dock to choose what appears in the HUD.

The main Continuo window is a control surface. Some buttons toggle layers over the game, while other buttons open dedicated tool windows. Turning the core Overlay off does not disable the other visual or training layers.

A good first setup is Set: Core, then enable Hitboxes or Hurtboxes only when you need them. Open Tools when you want the dedicated training and setup utilities.""",

Set: Core / Research / Full
Cycles between useful information presets. Core keeps the basic HUD concise. Research adds damage scaling and HS Scale. Full enables the broader live combat display while retaining both research gauges. Changing individual HUD toggles changes the preset to Custom.

Overlay
Shows or hides the core team HUD. Hitboxes, hurtboxes, ruler guides, Mission Mode, and trainer prompts are separate layers.

Hit / Block
Shows the live interaction ribbon for recent hit and block results.

Combo
Shows the live combo ledger and recent route information.

Dmg
Shows the live damage-scaling gauges. See the Damage Scaling topic for how to read them.

HS Scale
Shows a per-hit air-recovery expiry clock. The fill advances toward the scaled recovery point; the red end is the portion removed by combo deterioration. A new hit replaces the old clock immediately. See the Hitstun Scaling topic for details.

Meter
Adds meter gain and spend information beside the normal meter display.

Red HP
Shows recoverable health and its amount.

Research
Opens the standalone read-only Attack Research window. It is separate from the Research HUD preset.

Tag
Shows or hides the incoming tag resource card.

Clear
Hides optional HUD cards without clearing saved data or shutting Continuo down.

Tools
Expands the Training and Lab / Setup sections.

Help
Opens this guide.""",

Hurtboxes
Shows body and defender hurtbox drawings. The numbered buttons work independently from the hitbox filters.

Ruler
Shows saved active-frame reach guides. It does not require hitboxes or hurtboxes to remain visible.

Horizontal
Shows the furthest forward edge of saved active hitbox reach.

Vertical
Shows the full vertical active-hitbox envelope. Horizontal and Vertical can be enabled together.

Envelope
When Horizontal and Vertical are both enabled, Envelope adds the sampled 2D threat shape and its time heatmap. Turn Envelope off if you want both simple ruler axes without the filled 2D coverage shape.

The input monitor shows the recent control history being read from the game. It is intended to help verify execution, timing, and charge behavior without guessing what the game recognized.

Input rows
Recent presses and directional states are shown with their live frame duration. A direction or button that remains held continues counting instead of appearing as repeated new presses.

HOLD row
Long holds are promoted into the HOLD row so charge inputs are easy to spot. Continuo begins treating a continuous hold as charge-relevant after 26 frames. The frame count continues updating while the input remains held.

Release behavior
When the held input is released, the completed hold remains visible briefly so you can read the final duration instead of losing it immediately.

The Dmg HUD shows the live damage multiplier being applied to attacks. Think of the percentage as how much of the move's normal damage is currently being retained after the game's active modifiers.

100%
The move is currently using its normal damage value before any additional modifier shown by the gauge.

Below 100%
Damage is being reduced. Combo proration is the most common reason, but low-health effects and other game states can also contribute.

Above 100%
A positive damage modifier is active.

Labels
The HUD may identify contributors such as combo scaling, Baroque, Guts, Danger, team or DHC modifiers, Roll-specific modifiers, height-related effects, or another decoded modifier. The label tells you why the displayed multiplier changed rather than making you infer it from the final damage number alone.

Approximation marker
An asterisk means the displayed modifier is an inferred or approximate interpretation rather than a fully proven direct field. Treat it as useful live guidance, not a guaranteed internal formula.

This gauge is independent from hitstun scaling. Use the HS Scale button when you want to see air-recovery deterioration.""",

TvC deteriorates air-combo recovery lockout separately from ordinary grounded hitstun and separately from damage scaling. The HS Scale button shows that native system as a per-hit expiry clock.

Blue segment
Elapsed frames on the current hit. The fill starts at zero and advances one step whenever the native air-recovery timer decrements.

Gray segment
The runway still available before the scaled recovery endpoint.

Red segment
The part of the raw lockout that is no longer reachable because combo deterioration moved recovery earlier.

Stop marker
The defender's effective recovery endpoint for this hit. The fill stops here rather than filling the raw bar.

DECAY
The exact deterioration step from the native rule. The game removes one frame for every four qualifying count units.

Elapsed / target
The live recovery clock for every hit. It starts full and drains toward zero. Native +0x1220 air-recovery lockout is used when present; ordinary +0x1210 hitstun is the fallback so the clock is visible before decay begins. For example, a raw approximately 24F window with DECAY -4F can produce a 21F effective window that drains 21 through 0. The raw reconstruction is approximate because the HUD may observe the native timer after initialization.

New hit
A new combo hit immediately discards the previous clock and starts a fresh bar, even when the replacement lockout is shorter than the old timer had remaining.

NO TECH
The native CANTUKEMI state is active. Recovery is being blocked independently of the normal untech countdown.

FLOOR 4F
The deterioration branch never initializes the air-recovery lockout below four frames.

This is not ordinary DSTIFF hitstun. The normal resolved hitstun timer is a separate game field.""",

        """HOW TO READ FRAME DATA

Startup
Frames before the move becomes active.

Active
Frames where the attack can connect. Multi-part active ranges may be shown when a move turns active more than once.

Recovery
Frames after the active portion before the move finishes recovering.

Hitstop
The freeze applied when an attack connects.

Hitstun / Blockstun
How long the defender remains unable to act after being hit or blocking.

Observed Block Advantage
A live measured result from actual gameplay timing. When Continuo has a trustworthy observation, this is preferred over a derived estimate.

Derived Block Advantage
A calculated estimate from the available frame fields. It is useful when no live observation has been recorded yet.

Invuln
Frames where the fighter is not vulnerable to the relevant attack interaction.

Armor
A protection state that can absorb or resist a hit without behaving like ordinary invulnerability.

Counter
Marks a counter-style defensive or reactive property. It is not the same thing as armor or a guard point.

Guard Point
Frames where the move supplies a guarding state during the action.

Baroque Window
Frames where the move permits a Baroque cancel. This field does not mean the character currently has red health available for Baroque.

Protection
A broader decoded protection property used by the move. If the field includes [R], that entry is backed by a runtime observation or runtime-derived result.

Cancel Windows
The portions of the move where ordinary cancel transitions are permitted.

Custom Cancel
A move-specific cancel rule that does not fit the normal shared cancel categories.

Attack Property
Special attack behavior decoded from the move data.

Hit Reaction / Hit Result
What happens to the opponent on connection, such as knockback, knockdown, stagger, launcher, wallbounce, or another reaction.

Knockback / Launch fields
Describe the direction or trajectory applied by the hit.

Speed Mod
A move-specific playback or timing modifier when one is present.

SuperBG
Indicates the move's super-background behavior.

Address
The underlying memory location for the decoded move data. Normal users can ignore this field.

Frame Timeline
A visual summary of the move's startup, active, recovery, and other known timing regions.""",

Occurrence
Chooses which matching hit in the sequence can trigger the trainer. This is useful for multi-hit moves or repeated contacts.

Chance
Sets the probability that an otherwise valid trigger actually activates Megacrash. Lower values make the response less predictable.

Delay
Adds a frame delay between the matching hit and the Megacrash activation.

Cooldown
Prevents another automatic activation until the configured cooldown has expired.

Arm / Off
Arm enables the configured trainer. Off stops automatic Megacrash activation.

Trigger flow
While armed, Continuo watches for the selected attacker, move, and hit occurrence. When the conditions match, it rolls the configured chance, waits the selected delay, activates Megacrash, then observes the cooldown before another trigger is allowed.
