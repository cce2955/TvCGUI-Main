# tk_host.py
#
# Dedicated Tk host running on its own thread, with a hidden root.
# All Tk operations must be executed on the Tk thread via tk_call().
#
# Guarantees:
# - Exactly one tk.Tk() instance (the hidden host root)
# - User windows are tk.Toplevel(root)
# - tk_call() is safe to use immediately after ensure_tk_host(); it waits for root readiness
#
# Optional:
# - tk_call_sync() to get a return value or raise exceptions on the caller thread
