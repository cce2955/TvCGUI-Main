The tool will start automatically using the virtual environment.

If Python is missing

Download and install Python 3.10+ (64-bit) from https://www.python.org/downloads/

Then rerun setup.ps1.


After that, use run.bat and launch dolphin, or launch dolphin and then run.bat

Quick bugs and notes:

No giants at the moment, looking into it

I don't know how this works over netplay, my assumption is that either host controls the fun or you'll just get a desync for damage and hitbox adjustments, but for monitoring frame data and other goodies it should be perfectly fine

sometimes it'll lose track after a while, I need to readjust how I search for characters or build something to "re"search for characters, a savestate or dolphin restart usually fixes it, if it loads and everything is blank, chances are high it's lost the game

there's also a freeze on start, it's scraping through Dolphin to find character tables and get the data, I've tried everything to make it smoother, this is the best compromise

don't trust the frame adv tracker 100%, I did a lot of math to make it "mostly" accurate but there is some wacky things that come out of it

hitbox editor might not catch "all" hitboxes but I managed to whittle down what it probably is, if your character suffers let me know so I can investigate but everyone should mostly be good to go. Anyone with projectiles (sorry saki) will suffer more as that seems to have it's own table I have to find
